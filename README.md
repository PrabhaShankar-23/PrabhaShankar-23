👋 Hey there, I’m Prabha Shanker

🚀 Full Stack Architect | Backend Specialist | Cloud-Native System Designer

I love building things that scale beautifully — from sleek front-end experiences to resilient backend architectures. Over the years, I’ve worked across the stack, but I’ve got a soft spot for backend engineering, clean architecture, and distributed systems that just don’t break under pressure.

💡 My Current Stack

Frontend: React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, Express.js, REST & GraphQL APIs

Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices, Kafka, CI/CD Pipelines

Architecture Focus: Event-driven design, System scalability, Cloud-native solutions

🤝 Let’s collaborate on

Scalable full stack projects

Backend-heavy architectures & performance tuning

DevOps automation and system design discussions
